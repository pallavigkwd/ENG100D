# CCE Data Analysis Project

## Structure of the repository

* data_cleaning.py - functions for cleaning the raw datasets
* data_analysis.py - functions for plotting and obtaining information from the data
* data_report.ipynb - final report with analysis and findings from the data.
    * it currently has data from March 2023 to February 2024 but should be updated with latest data, preferably comprising entire years

## Use of the documents

In order to perform the analysis, we have established functions that do all the work for you: you just need to call them with the dataset you want to analyze, and it will perform and display the analysis for you.

All the analysis is performed by the year, so the data should encompass an entire year.

## Recommendations

* Find all the missing data from 2022 to 2023
